# ================================== General ===================================

# The name of the shipper that publishes the network data. It can be used to group
# all the transactions sent by a single shipper in the web interface.
#name:

# The tags of the shipper are included in their own field with each
# transaction published.
#tags: ["service-X", "web-tier"]

# Optional fields that you can specify to add additional information to the
# output.
#fields:
#  env: staging

# =================================== Kibana ===================================

# Starting with Beats version 6.0.0, the dashboards are loaded via the Kibana API.
# This requires a Kibana endpoint configuration.
setup.kibana:
    # Kibana Host
    # Scheme and port can be left out and will be set to the default (http and 5601)
    # In case you specify and additional path, the scheme is required: http://localhost:5601/path
    # IPv6 addresses should always be defined as: https://[2001:db8::1]:5601
    host: "https://kibana:5601"

    # Kibana Space ID
    # ID of the Kibana Space into which the dashboards should be loaded. By default,
    # the Default Space will be used.
    #space.id:

# =============================== Elastic Cloud ================================

# These settings simplify using Heartbeat with the Elastic Cloud (https://cloud.elastic.co/).

# The cloud.id setting overwrites the `output.elasticsearch.hosts` and
# `setup.kibana.host` options.
# You can find the `cloud.id` in the Elastic Cloud web UI.
#cloud.id:

# The cloud.auth setting overwrites the `output.elasticsearch.username` and
# `output.elasticsearch.password` settings. The format is `<user>:<pass>`.
#cloud.auth:

# ================================== Outputs ===================================

# Configure what output to use when sending the data collected by the beat.

# ---------------------------- Elasticsearch Output ----------------------------
output.elasticsearch:
    # Array of hosts to connect to.
    hosts: ["http://elasticsearch:9200"]

    # Protocol - either `http` (default) or `https`.
    protocol: "http"

    # Authentication credentials - either API key or username/password.
    # use keystore command to defined ES_API_KEY.
    # For example `/usr/share/packetbeat/bin/packetbeat keystore add ES_API_KEY -c /etc/packetbeat/packetbeat.yml --path.home /usr/share/packetbeat --path.data /var/lib/packetbeat`
    # api_key: "${ES_API_KEY}"
    username: "elastic"
    password: "integration-project-pwd"
# ------------------------------ Logstash Output -------------------------------
#output.logstash:
# The Logstash hosts
#hosts: ["localhost:5044"]

# Optional SSL. By default is off.
# List of root certificates for HTTPS server verifications
#ssl.certificate_authorities: ["/etc/pki/root/ca.pem"]

# Certificate for SSL client authentication
#ssl.certificate: "/etc/pki/client/cert.pem"

# Client Certificate Key
#ssl.key: "/etc/pki/client/cert.key"

# ================================= Processors =================================

# processors:
# - add_observer_metadata:
# Optional, but recommended geo settings for the location Heartbeat is running in
#   geo:
# Token describing this location
#   name: Madrid, Spain
# Lat, Lon "
#   location: "40.4378698, -3.8196205"
# ================================== Logging ===================================

# Sets log level. The default log level is info.
# Available log levels are: error, warning, info, debug
#logging.level: debug

# At debug level, you can selectively enable logging only for some components.
# To enable all selectors use ["*"]. Examples of other selectors are "beat",
# "publisher", "service".
#logging.selectors: ["*"]

# ============================= X-Pack Monitoring ==============================
# Heartbeat can export internal metrics to a central Elasticsearch monitoring
# cluster.  This requires xpack monitoring to be enabled in Elasticsearch.  The
# reporting is disabled by default.

# Set to true to enable the monitoring reporter.
#monitoring.enabled: false

# Sets the UUID of the Elasticsearch cluster under which monitoring data for this
# Heartbeat instance will appear in the Stack Monitoring UI. If output.elasticsearch
# is enabled, the UUID is derived from the Elasticsearch cluster referenced by output.elasticsearch.
#monitoring.cluster_uuid:

# Uncomment to send the metrics to Elasticsearch. Most settings from the
# Elasticsearch output are accepted here as well.
# Note that the settings should point to your Elasticsearch *monitoring* cluster.
# Any setting that is not set is automatically inherited from the Elasticsearch
# output configuration, so if you have the Elasticsearch output configured such
# that it is pointing to your Elasticsearch monitoring cluster, you can simply
# uncomment the following line.
#monitoring.elasticsearch:

# ============================== Instrumentation ===============================

# Instrumentation support for the heartbeat.
#instrumentation:
# Set to true to enable instrumentation of heartbeat.
#enabled: false

# Environment in which heartbeat is running on (eg: staging, production, etc.)
#environment: ""

# APM Server hosts to report instrumentation results to.
#hosts:
#  - http://localhost:8200

# API Key for the APM Server(s).
# If api_key is set then secret_token will be ignored.
#api_key:

# Secret token for the APM Server(s).
#secret_token:

# ================================= Migration ==================================

# This allows to enable 6.7 migration aliases
#migration.6_to_7.enabled: true
